    "We redesigned the part of time recording. However, due to the experiment of `Inference Time` *vs* `Group Numbers`, we had no time to run this part so far. To deliver the `Inference Time` *vs* `Group Numbers` graph, we integrated `BIBD` and `Group Convolution` with ResNet-34. After that, we recorded the related results and the figure is shown as follows.\n",

    "**Figure 1.1** The result shows that in general the increasing of the group number may entail slightly more time to inference. It is somewhat surprising that the inference time of ResNet-34 at group number 0 is abnormally high. A further check (debug) is necessary.\n",
